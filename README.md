*LAB 4: THE DINING PHILOSOPHER PROBLEM*

This lab is a that provides a solution to the famous Dining Philosopher Problem that is starvation-free and 
deadlock-free. The constraints we had to cosider when solving this problem:

• Only one philosopher can hold a fork at a time.

• It must be impossible for a deadlock to occur.

• It must be impossible for a philosopher to starve waiting for a fork.

• It must be possible for more than one philosopher to eat at the same time. 


*TO COMPILE AND RUN*

_In Eclipse, IntelliJ, or other Java compiler_:

We used a jdk version 9
 
_Run the command in stdlinux_: 

    $ javac DiningRoomPhilosopher.java

    $ java DiningRoomPhilosopher
